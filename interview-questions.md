# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the condition of running a function repeatedly until it meets a condition that you have specified.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process where a set of instructions or statements is executed repeatedly for a specified number of time or until a condition is met.


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters of map takes the whole array and returns the same length of the original array after doing something to everything in the array. Not sure which are optional.

  Researched answer: Map is a collection of elements where each element is stored as a Key, value pair. Map object can hold both objects and primitive values as either key or value. When we iterate over the map object it returns the key,value pair in the same order as inserted.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is the process of using the object brackets to get the values out that are in the object to use more easily.

  Researched answer: Destructuring is a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, and maps and set them into new, distinct variables. Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from an array​ at a time.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: There is no real difference they are pretty much the same. A method is a built in function within Javascript.

  Researched answer: A function can be called directly by its name.	A method consists of a code that can be called by the name of its object and its method name using dot notation or square bracket notation..
  A function can pass the data that is operated and may return the data. 	The method operates the data contained in a Class.
  Data passed to a function is explicit.	A method implicitly passes the object on which it was called.
  A function lives on its own.	A method is a function associated with an object property.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is an object that contains preset data that you set and contains a a constructor that allows you to have the data change as the input changes without having to manually change it everytime. An object is technically just the curly brackets that make it an object. A class IS an object.

  Researched answer: a class can be considered as a construct that encapsulates a group of variables and methods; whereas, an object acts as member or instance of that class.


6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Not exactly sure what hoisting is. I think it has something to do with relaying external data to your code.

  Researched answer: JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter allocates memory for variable and function declarations prior to execution of the code.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Class inheritance is a way for one class to extend another class. So we can create new functionality on top of the existing.
                      
2. React: React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.

3. React state: an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, “state” is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

4. React lifecycle methods: 
constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
render()

5. DOM: Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. ... As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
